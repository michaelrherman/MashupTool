# MashupTool
A tool for use in the creation of mashups.

This tool requires an EchoNest API key to work. It's optional to have a Reddit user ID and password but necessary if you intend to share your results onto Reddit. Place these items, each on their own line, in a text file titled keyAPI.txt in your project file.
